# Membership

We currently offer two types of membership for KAO. Please determine which type of membership you would like to apply for, and then specify that option on our sign-up form.

### Full Membership

Membership is **open** to all Kent State University students with an interest in aviation. Membership is not required to attend meetings, but is encouraged, and necessary to receive the full benefits of the KSU ATC Organization.

If you are a Kent State University student, you are eligible to become a full member of the KSU ATC Organization. All majors are welcomed.

### Affiliate Membership

Affiliate membership is also available to any non-KSU affiliated person who wishes to join. Affiliate membership includes the opportunity to participate in ANY and ALL KAO activities. The only limitation is that affiliate members may not cast a vote for officer elections.

### You can become a member [here](http://kentstateatc.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=43d96d7228aa8f1f9461ceb13&id=fe135b2a2a).
