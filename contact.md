For those who do not already take advantage of our $2.1M Air Traffic Control Simulator, try visiting during Open Lab hours, especially Fridays, from 10:00am until 4:00pm. Scott and I will both be working during this Open Lab, and will able to answer questions and help you master the art of Air Traffic Control. No experience required; just come on up, and we'll show you all you want to know. Trust us: you'll love it.
