### View KAO's Officer Positions

President:
- 
The President of KAO is responsible for the overall operation of the organization as a whole. The President will develop and execute a year plan for the organization, and make full use of all resources to provide the best overall product to the member body. The President will be expected, within reason, to be present at every single KAO meeting, event, activity, etc. The President should be an established leader, who can effectively delegate and supervise tasks and keep the organization on schedule without carrying an immense personal load.

Vice President:
-
The Vice President of KAO has probably the most loosely defined role of all officials. Acting as a "man of action", this person will be expected to take on the logistics and coordination side of "making things happen". They must be just as reliable and hard-working as the President.

Clerk of Events:
-
The Clerk of Events of KAO shall hold the responsibilities of the typical "treasurer" **and** "secretary". Vaguely put, the Clerk will just keep track of things, and provide a prideful "year-in-review" presentation to highlight KAO's annual successes.

Public Relations Director:
-
The Public Relations Director of KAO holds most of the responsibility for coordinating between the organization and other outside entities (CAEST, KSU, other student organizations, local aviation programs like ACE), for advertising and maintaining a strong KAO presence within the Van Deusen and aeronautical environments, as well as for developing and managing the implementation of KAO's line of apparel. The PR Director will also coordinate with the Class Representatives when necessary and as desired in order to help create a positive appearance of KAO to the student body, college administration, and general public.

Class Representatives (one per projected graduation year):
-
These individuals will be the "go-to" person among their classmates when it comes to information about KAO. Class Representatives will be kept very much in the loop of KAO happenings, and will play a certain role in gently recruiting Aeronautics students.

Controller & Pilot Specialists:
-
These individuals will be appointed to these positions, though anyone may indicate interest by [emailing us] (mailto:desk@kentstateatc.org). They will be made available to the organization to give presentation(s) on advanced topics within their specialty.
