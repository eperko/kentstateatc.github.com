### President:

The President of KAO is responsible for the overall operation of the organization. The President will develop and execute a year plan for the KAO, and make full use of all resources to provide the best possible experience to the member body. The President is expected to have a contagious passion for the organization; one that inspires all KAO leaders to drive the organization "Upward and Onward". Unlike the Vice President, the President focuses almost entirely on overseeing the continued efforts of KAO Leadership. At all costs, the President should work to prevent any stagnancy within KAO.

### Vice President:

The Vice President of KAO should be in constant contact with the President, working to keep all of KAO's projects moving forward. The Vice President shall be responsible for making most detail-oriented organization decisions, and shall directly support the Officers with any tasks deemed appropriate. This position requires an especially proactive work ethic, coupled with a humble management style. Reports to the President.

### Clerk of Events:

The Clerk of Events of KAO shall hold the responsibilities of a typical "treasurer", "secretary" **and** will be the main interface of event planning and management. Examples of duties shall include coming up with activities, coordinating event sign-ups, reserving and assembling KAO's table at various events (Blastoff, Aviation Heritage Fair), and managing KAO's finances. Reports to the Vice President.

### Public Relations Director:

The PR Director is involved closely in every internal organizational decision made by KAO Officers. The opinion of the PR Director is especially important, because it represents the input of the member body. Thus, it is expected that the PR Director will check in regularly with the Class Representatives, and report any topics of interest to the Vice President every other week. Additional responsibilities include managing KAO Apparel, social media, and the soon-to-be-born Quarterly "iKAO Newsletter". Reports to the Vice President.

### Class Representatives (one per projected graduation year):

Class Representatives play a critical role in KAO. They are expected to represent the interests and desires, as well as the complaints and complements, of their graduating class to KAO Leadership. As Class Representative, brutal honesty is very important. KAO Leadership thrives on feedback, positive and negative, to shape the organization to please its members. Class Representatives will be kept "in the loop" by the Officers, and will hold some minor responsibilities, such as recruitment and sharing ideas and feedback to the rest of KAO leadership. Reports to the PR Director.
