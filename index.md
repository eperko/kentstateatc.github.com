# A message from the founders 

### Welcome to the Kent State Air Traffic Control Association

Newly founded in September of 2012, "KAO" will be the ultimate resource to all aviation enthusiasts. Aside from exciting guest speakers and aviation facility tours, KAO's weekly meetings will include discussions of fascinating, advanced topics in the field of aviation, with a special interest to air traffic controllers.

Our members include the BEST of Kent Aeronautics, from air traffic controllers to pilots and airport managers. Members can expect a great deal from this organization. They can expect the best efforts of staff and leadership to deliver the highest quality and detail of information, as well as the best opportunities for expanding members' knowledgebase. The goal of this student organization is to help students grow to become aviation professionals, with an all-encompassing understanding and intuition of aviation that sets Kent State University above all other schools for Air Traffic Control.
