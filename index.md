# A message from the founders 

### Welcome to the Kent State Air Traffic Control Association

Newly founded in September of 2012, KAO has been taking great strides forward with our incredible aeronautics program here at Kent. Following feedback from our valued members, we have restructured our approach to educating and have shifted focus to active simulation, which takes place in the Air Traffic Control Simulator Lab.

Our members include the BEST of Kent Aeronautics, from air traffic controllers to pilots to airport managers. Members can expect a great deal from this organization. They can expect the best efforts of staff and leadership to deliver the highest quality and detail of information, as well as the best opportunities for expanding members' knowledge-base. The goal of this student organization is to help students grow to become aviation professionals, with an all-encompassing understanding and intuition of aviation that sets Kent State University above all other schools for Air Traffic Control.

To become a member (free and open registration), see our [membership page](/membership/). For more information about KAO, send us an email at <desk@kentstateatc.org>.
