# Become an Officer with KAO

If you are a full member of KAO, and wish to become an officer, the process is described below:

Stage I:
Complete the [KAO Leadership Board Application] ("https://www.dropbox.com/s/zbb0x9yo2qolcwo/Leadership.pdf"), and attach it below with your application to be placed on the 2013 General Election ballot.

Stage II:
The advisor of the organization will review all applications, and only the top 4 for each position will be placed on the ballot. Please note that the advisor retains the right to refuse any candidate's placement onto the ballot, and the ATC Lab Instructors retain the right to reject any winning candidate if they determine the candidate is unfit for the job.

Stage III:
After you are approved, you will receive an email from KAO advising you so, and you will be placed on the ballot for the General Election.

Stage IV:
The General Election takes place, and if you beat all opponents for the desired position, you will hold that position for the entire academic year. The President will brief you on your responsibilities, and begin assigning orientational tasks for your duties.
