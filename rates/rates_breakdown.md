# R.A.T.E.S. Modes
 
R.A.T.E.S. is a multi-suite driven simulation. If you don't know what that means, information on triple-plays is available [here](/tripleplay/).

There are 3 different modes to RATES, and understanding them is important, to decide which interests you the most.

# THE QUAD

Contrary to popular belief, the TRACON airspace used in our classes is not what you will see at the Academy. Instead, it's a modified version of Jackson Approach. "The QUAD" is based on the actual airspace used at the FAA Academy for radar approach control training. In our configuration, it is split into four sectors, all of which will be controlled by a KSU ATC student-- hence the name of "The QUAD".

# MISSY

Called "Missy" as in Mississippi, this mode of RATES includes the configuration you will see at the FAA Academy if pursuing the Enroute option. Aero Center's Jackson Low sector is the main enrotue sector used, however we also enable its surrounding enroute sectors, an Aero Center high sector (45), Jackson Approach and Monroe Approach. There is no tower available in this configuration.

# CFS

CFS stands for "Combined Facility Simulations", and was the original intent of the R.A.T.E.S. program, as well as the program's original name. CFS includes Aero Center, with Academy Airport and its surrounding (authentic) Academy TRACON set in place of Jackson Approach. This is our largest mode of RATES, and can accomodate up to 18 control positions simultaneously, or 30 if you include Enroute D-Side controllers, a Traffic Management Unit, Clearance Delivery and Flight Data positions. Do the math... that's up to 58 students who can all be involved in a single scenario.
