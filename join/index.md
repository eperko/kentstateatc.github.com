# Join up

### Minimum Separation Through Maximum Education

Membership is **open** to all Kent State University students with an interest in aviation. Membership is not required to attend meetings, but is encouraged, and necessary to receive the full benefits of the KSU ATC Organization.

Affiliate membership is also available to any non-KSU affiliated person who wishes to join. Affiliate membership includes the opportunity to participate in ANY and ALL KAO activities. The only limitation is that affiliate members may not cast a vote for officer elections.

For more information, please do not hesitate to ask any questions that may be on your mind. Send an email to <desk@kentstateatc.org> and Scott or I will get back to you as soon as possible.

We hope you will join us in our high-performance climb into the beautiful world of aviation.
